# CITM-FIGHTERS
CITM Fighters is a 2-player videogame created with Unity for the Animaci√≥ 3D course. This game consists of a "Street Fighters" style martial arts combat in which the player who hits first wins.

The fighters are two models of Goku (Dragon Ball Z), who must hit the other first to win, you can play both in controller and keyboard and mouse.

The model and scenery have been provided by the teacher, but the animations are made by me in Maya, referencing me from various sources on Youtube.

This is the link to the playlist used for the [animations](<https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaRfrYhnHLeMmbCPezzNNkOYi2kzZXEYp&si=0E9fONrFTFp0BnLL>).
