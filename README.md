# CITM-FIGHTERS
CITM Fighters is a 2-player videogame created with Unity for the Animaci√≥ 3D course. This game consists of a "Street Fighters" style martial arts combat in which the player who hits first wins.

The fighters are two models of Goku (Dragon Ball Z), who must hit the other first to win, you can play both in controller and keyboard and mouse.

The model and scenery have been provided by the teacher, but the animations are made by me in Maya, referencing me from various sources on Youtube.

This is the link to the playlist used for the [animations](<https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaRfrYhnHLeMmbCPezzNNkOYi2kzZXEYp&si=0E9fONrFTFp0BnLL>).

## The Game
Here we can see a few reference pictures of the project and its build, as well as a 2 minutes gameplay of the game.


## Animations 
### Idle Animation 
This animation lasts 30 seconds, is fast enough so as not to hinder the animations that follow it and does not move too much in order to achieve a natural movement.

### Walk Forward Animation
The Walk Forward Animation lasts 15 seconds, it is a quick animation to be able to quickly approach or move away from the opponent, as the player needs to be able to dodge attacks quickly due to the rules of the game.

Like the Walk Forward Animation, the Walk Backward Animation is a quick animation that also lasts 15 seconds.

### Evade Low Attack
The animation to dodge the high attack lasts 45 seconds, it is a long animation as it is suspended 3 seconds in the air to give time for the low attack animations to pick up the leg.

### Dodge High Attack
This animation lasts 30 seconds, it is a long animation because you need to stay down long enough for the opponent's fist to be picked up.

### Quick Attack
The Quick Attack animation lasts 30 seconds, it is a fast animation as it is spread over two punches, but it is slow enough to be dodged or blocked.

## References 
Of course, the animations are not completely invented, I have taken inspiration from various videos and youtube channels to get ideas and references on how to make the movements. Check out that list [HERE](<https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaRfrYhnHLeMmbCPezzNNkOYi2kzZXEYp&si=dvfUFoILNyzf2knO>)
